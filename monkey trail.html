        <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
        <p>Wild Monkey Swimming Pool & Trail
Visiting this exhibit brings guests to the home of the Java Macaques, which are native to Southeast Asia. These monkeys are the soul of Monkey Jungle, being the first primates introduced to the park and accounting for the majority of the primates in the park. This 7-acre exhibit provides the guests the opportunity to spectate Java Macaques in an environment similar to one that the species thrives in Southeast Asia. Stick around long enough and guests may even have the opportunity to see them dive into the pond in search of snacks.[5]

Daily presentation times for this exhibit are: 10:00 am, 12:15 pm, 2:30 pm, and 4:30 pm</p>
